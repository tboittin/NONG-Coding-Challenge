Hi guys from NONG, thanks for giving me the opportunity to apply to this internship !

**TLDR: The app link is here: https://nong-coding-project.web.app/.**

First of all, I would like to say that I had limited time to build this app as I was in vacation and with limited access to my computer and/or internet, no prior experience with firebase and rush timing to make accomodations for my fligth on December 6th.

Therefore I decided to make things a bit faster & easier by boostraping the longest part in my opinion which is authentification. I found a solution in a firebase tutorial made by Web Dev Simplified (WDS). I detailled it below.
I used other videos to help me with firestore and hosting, I will also put the links.

For the styling part, I used the React-Bootstrap library since WDS used it in his app and I had experience using it so it was easier. I worked on the UX, but it can be improved a lot since the main goal was to make a functional app and time was limited. I apologise in advance for the boorish toast but I figured that a notification about the submission of the form would be a nice addition.

I added a list of potential improvements at the end of this document.

Have a good day !

Thomas

# 1- Boostraping authentification

This app has been bootstraped using a existing project made by Kyle Cook a.k.a. Web Dev Simplified. It's a React App using Firebase for authentification. Its features are :

- Sign Up
- Log in
- Log out
- Update profile (editing user's password)
- Forgot Password
- Auth restrict access

Here's his github repo as well as the video in which he builds the app:

# 3- Potential improvement

- Having an image upload field so user can take pictures of the subject of the note.
- Have a field to connect a note to particular projects or connecting it to concerned plant.
- Adding a user Id to notes to replace the name input field.
- Having 2 tabs to access the notes the user submitted and all the notes submitted by all the users.
- Improving the design with a nice typo, nice colors and nice picture ... :)
